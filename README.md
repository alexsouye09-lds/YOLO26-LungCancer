# YOLO26-LungCancer
OLO26-LungCancer

💙 Lung Cancer Detection with 98% mAP – Project done at 16 years old!
My thoughts are with everyone affected. Early detection saves lives.

Why YOLO26m + MuSGD?

✅ 98% mAP on CT scans (Malignant/Benign/Normal)

✅ MuSGD optimizer: slower but superior convergence

✅ Clinically-ready inference speed

✅ Ultralytics YOLO26m: democratizing medical AI

Objective

Contributing to saving lives through technology.
🙏 Special thanks to Ultralytics for democratizing AI for the greater good.
